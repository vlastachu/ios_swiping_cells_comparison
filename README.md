# An overview of some iOS swiping cell libs

On my project was **`MKSlidingTableViewCell`** which not provide autolayout. 
Default (since iOS 9) **`UITableViewRowAction`** is not provide enough customizations.
BMX is just random ðŸ’©. 
**`MGSwipeTableCell`** is looks ok (left/right button, animations, not very custom views but enough).
